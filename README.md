# network-project

Network-Project is my first attempt at building a Twitter clone. It contains back-end work using Python and Django as well as front-end work using Vanilla JS. 
This project was designed to practice the Single Responsibility Principle - i.e., keeping the front-end and back-end separate in their functions and actions. Thus,
there is quite a lot of client-side rendering happening in this project, accessing the server when the client needs to interact with the database (SQLite3) using HTTP
requests. 

To access the code, navigate to network => any .py file as well as any .html file in the template/network folder.
